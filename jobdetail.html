  All through, Software and Application development has gain the world attention because of its massive contribution made to the world through means of easy living. Moreover, knowing that it is the fasted growing area within the IT industry with high demand for product, job opportunity projected to rise higher in ten (10) years, However, with my curiosity to know more about this career, I strongly believe that this field will create a unique chance for me to contribute to the world, most especially to my country Liberia.
  </p>
  <p id="jobdetialpara">Meanwhile, I am a child of nine (9), very egger about my education and my future as well. It is true that my parent may won’t to contribute massively in my studies, but unfortunately for me they are currently in a serious financial hardship, their income is very low to give me a helping hand when it comes to tuition fees. With all that I have been teaching myself with some free online tutorials which enable me to create a website voluntarily for my community netball sport team, and the site is called “paynesvillenetball.weebly.com.” I have been consistently proving myself throughout my previous studies and with this unique experience I had, I have never stop searching or trying to find ways and means to improve myself by obtaining a Bachelor in Computer Science and also to do what is necessary to meet my further goal.
  However, I am 23 years of age, very curious to learn more about Software and Application engineering. If I am considering for this important opportunity, I will strive as possible to do my best to represent myself and reward those who have granted me a chance to improve myself and also empowering me to achieve my career in becoming a Software and Application engineering In Liberia.</p>
  <p id="jobdetialpara">Well, it is true that your embassy has not yet post a scholarship opportunity but, being a Software engineer means everything to me, as well as my family who is depending on us to experience better life tomorrow. However, I appreciate your consideration, think you for taking the time to evaluate this application, and I am hope to hear from you soon.
  Meanwhile, in case you want to know much about my moral character and behavior, I have attached a recommendation letter from my church, references, along with my birth certificate and passport information.</p>
  <p>Sincerely yours</p>
